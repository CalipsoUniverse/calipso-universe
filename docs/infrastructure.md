# CLP Infrastructure Architecture

## Overview

CLP is deployed as the cultural infrastructure layer of the Calipso Universe ecosystem.

The launch model, liquidity structure, and authority configuration are intentionally designed for long-term stability rather than short-term speculation.

---

## Launch Model

CLP follows a liquidity-based decentralized launch model.

- Liquidity Pool: Meteora
- Routing Layer: Jupiter Aggregator
- Network: Solana
- Initial Liquidity: 10,000,000 CLP paired with SOL

The token is not pre-sold.
There is no private allocation round.
There is no insider distribution outside the documented allocation structure.

---

## Liquidity Architecture

- Liquidity is permanently locked at launch.
- No liquidity withdrawal mechanism is retained.
- No hidden liquidity channels exist.

This ensures structural market continuity and mitigates rug risk.

---

## Authority Configuration

CLP authority model is minimized:

- Mint Authority: Revoked
- Freeze Authority: Revoked
- Metadata: Immutable
- Update Authority: Restricted to non-monetary metadata only

No future token supply expansion is possible.

---

## Founder Reserve Structure

Founder allocations are:

- Segmented
- Time-locked
- Structured via documented vesting architecture

Operational reserve is separated from long-term strategic reserve.

Cold storage principles are applied to long-term holdings.

---

## Treasury Model

Treasury is structured for:

- Ecosystem growth
- Development funding
- Brand expansion
- Infrastructure maintenance

Treasury unlocks follow the documented vesting schedule.

---

## Routing & Market Access

CLP is accessible via:

- Jupiter Aggregator routing
- Direct LP interaction
- On-chain swaps

No centralized exchange dependency exists for baseline liquidity access.

---

## Design Philosophy

The infrastructure prioritizes:

- Transparency
- Authority minimization
- Liquidity permanence
- Long-term narrative continuity

CLP is designed as infrastructure, not a hype-driven asset.

---

## Transparency Commitment

At launch, the following will be publicly documented:

- Official Mint Address
- Liquidity Pool Address
- DEX Listing References
- Vesting Architecture
- Security Configuration

Calipso Universe infrastructure is built for durability.
