# Calipso Universe

Calipso Universe is a story-driven mythological IP.

It is not a product.
It is not a single token.
It is a universe designed to unfold over time.

## What is Calipso?

Calipso is a long-term creative universe built around:
- Books & narrative lore
- Symbolic systems and myth architecture
- Digital artifacts
- A community-powered token (CLP) on Solana

CLP is not a financial product.
It represents participation, culture, and continuity inside the universe.

Some things are not meant to launch.

They are meant to awaken.
Slowly.
In silence.

This repository is intentionally minimal.
Calipso is built in layers — not all at once.
